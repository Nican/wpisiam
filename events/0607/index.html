<h2>Wednesday, March 21, 2007</h2>
<p><strong>4-5 pm</strong><br />
<strong>Stratton Hall 202</strong><br />
<strong>Mathematics and Supercomputing</strong><br />
<strong>Brian Skjerven</strong></p>
<p>Currently, computer modeling and simulation are important aspects of nearly every applied research area, and complex problems exist that require the use of high-performance computers. Numerical methods are also incorporated to help solve these large problems. This blend of mathematics, numerical computation, and physical or biological systems is a growing field known as computational science. This talk is intended for students who may be interested in pursuing a career in computational science. I will talk about my internship experience at IBM and the tumor growth research I am currently working on. I will also provide an introduction to IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer as well several visual demonstrations. </p>

<h2>Tuesday, Feb. 27, 2007</h2>
<p><strong>7:00 - 8:00 pm</strong><br />
<strong>Stratton Hall 306</strong><br />
<strong>LaTeX Training Session</strong></p>
<p>The WPI student chapter of SIAM will host an introduction to the typesetting language of LaTeX.  LaTeX is used by a large number of academic journals, particularly those in the fields of mathematics and physics, and can be used to create high-quality, professional-looking documents that contain mathematical equations.  So if you're tired of using Equation Editor for your MQP or thesis, come and get a free introduction to LaTeX.</p>

<h2>Thursday, Nov 9, 2006</h2>
<p><strong>4:00pm - 5:00pm</strong><br />
<strong>Stratton Hall Student Lounge</strong><br />
<strong>Math Hour</strong></p>
<p>Informal presentation and conversation with guest mathematician Dr. Ronald Mosier, who will discuss his career as a mathematician working in the "real world". Dr. Mosier is a retired applied mathematician who has worked with distinction at Chrysler for several decades.</p>

<h2>Thursday, Oct 5, 2006</h2>
<p><strong>4:00pm - 5:00pm, Higgins Labs 218</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;Environmental Modeling in Practice: From Equations to War Stories&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Charles Hadlock</strong></p>
<p>Using examples from over twenty years' experience in applying mathematical methods to analyze environmental problems of industry, the speaker will discuss fundamental mathematical modeling concepts and their application in the real world.  The emphasis will be on hazardous materials risk and point source air pollution, but the methods extend to other environmental issues as well.</p>
<p>Prof. Charles Hadlock is a Trustee Professor at Bentley College and spent much of his career with the consulting firm of Arthur D. Little, Inc., leading an international practice in environmental risk.  He is the author of the MAA volume: Mathematical Modeling in the Environment.</p>
