<strong>Cloud Resolving Modeling of Tropical Convection</strong><br />

<p>Cloud resolving models provide a detailed look at the convective motions that form clouds, and these models incorporate physical processes including fluid dynamics, phase changes, formation of ice and liquid precipitation (called cloud microphysics), sedimentation of precipitation and radiation (both visible and infrared) that are important in the atmosphere. Each of these processes includes a number of approximations, but together they make explicit simulations of deep convective clouds (i.e. thunderstorms) possible. Such models may be used to improve our understanding of convective cloud processes and the interactions of convection with larger-scale atmospheric circulations. In this talk, the construction of such a model will be discussed with attention to the approximations made at each step. Applications of a cloud resolving model to simulations of tropical convection will also be presented.</p>
